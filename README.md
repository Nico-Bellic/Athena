# Athena
This is an application I created to test Oracle's Generative OCI. Its purpose is to assist developers in identifying errors in their applications and databases more effectively. The AI will have access to the entire database and all the pages of the application where it is embedded.

In order for the application to function correctly, you need to go to SQL Workshop -> Sample Datasets and download the HR data. Inside this dataset, you'll find the OEHR_DEPARTMENTS table, which the AI uses in this demonstration.
